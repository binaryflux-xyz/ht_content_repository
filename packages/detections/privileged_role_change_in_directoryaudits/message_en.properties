      description = Detects when a user is added to or removed from a high-privilege Azure AD role such as Global Administrator, Privileged Role Administrator, or Application Administrator. These changes may indicate potential privilege escalation or unauthorized administrative activity. The detection includes suppression for known automation accounts, trusted IPs, and PIM-related events to reduce false positives.
